# Critical Thinking Framework for Contributors

This document provides a structured approach to analyzing issues and making decisions in our project. Use these questions to thoroughly evaluate problems, propose solutions, and implement changes.

## Who - Understanding Stakeholders

1. Who is affected by this issue?
2. Who faces the biggest consequences?
3. Who holds the power in this situation?
4. Who might see this differently?
5. Who are the key stakeholders involved?
6. Who benefits from this outcome?
7. Who else should be consulted?
8. Who can provide more information?

## What - Analyzing the Issue

1. What is the issue at hand?
2. What are the main arguments?
3. What is the evidence?
4. What assumptions are being made?
5. What are the potential consequences?
6. What alternatives exist?
7. What are the risks of each alternative?
8. What steps can be taken next?

## Where - Location and Resources

1. Where did this first become an issue?
2. Where is the problem most evident?
3. Where can we find supporting data?
4. Where have solutions worked before?
5. Where are resources most needed?
6. Where are potential obstacles located?
7. Where can we implement solutions first?
8. Where should we monitor the outcomes?

## When - Timing and Schedule

1. When did this issue first emerge?
2. When do the effects typically appear?
3. When was the data last collected?
4. When is the best time to act?
5. When have solutions been attempted?
6. When is the deadline for action?
7. When should we expect to see results?
8. When will we review progress?

## Why - Understanding Purpose

1. Why is this issue significant?
2. Why did it arise in the first place?
3. Why are certain solutions preferred?
4. Why might opinions differ?
5. Why has this not been addressed sooner?
6. Why are some more affected than others?
7. Why is immediate action necessary?
8. Why should we revisit it in the future?

## How - Implementation and Process

1. How did this issue start?
2. How does this impact different groups?
3. How can we gather more data?
4. How have others tackled similar issues?
5. How will we implement the solution?
6. How will we measure success?
7. How should we communicate changes?
8. How often should we reassess?

## Using This Framework

When contributing to this project:

1. Use these questions to analyze issues thoroughly before proposing solutions
2. Document your analysis using this framework in issue descriptions and pull requests
3. Consider multiple perspectives and potential impacts
4. Back your proposals with data and evidence
5. Think through implementation details and potential consequences

Remember that good solutions come from thorough analysis and consideration of multiple viewpoints. This framework helps ensure we don't miss important aspects of any issue we're trying to solve.
